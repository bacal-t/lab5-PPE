<h1> PPE Laboratory Work 5 </h1>
<h2>Title:</h2>
Collaboration. Complex application

## Contents
* Collaboration
* All previously studied things

## Mandatory Objectives
* Create an application which has:
  * Child windows controls
  * GDI animation
* Animation should be controlled by controls

## Objectives With Points
* Work on this project in a team of 2-4 `(2 pt)`
  * Divide tasks and describe them in readme (for each task indicate who is responsible for it) `(1 pt)`
  * Use `pull requests` in order to merge your code `(2 pt)`
* Make it useful (you may be asked (by me) to evaluate the usefulness of your application idea) `(0-3 pt)`
* First create a sketch, then work on code `(1 pt)` _(commit sketches early)_

### Our Team:
- Gaidău Mihai
- Sclifos Corina
- Bacal Tatiana

### Game:
The main idea of our game is typically "Arcanoid". This is a simple game where you have only a ball, a paddle and briks (which you have to destroy).

#### How To Play:
- Controls: Use left/right arrow buttons to control your paddle, to through your ball use space button.
- Rules: Destroy all blocks and don’t forget to beat back your ball with paddle.

### Gaidău Mihai Task:
Tasks My task was to draw the bricks and the ball. Also i had to write the code for wall,bricks and player collisions.

### Sclifos Corina Task: 
At this laboratory work I have created schemes of levels and I also have created a class for the player controlled paddle.

### Bacal Tatiana Task: 
My task in this laboratory was to add more features at this game like changing colour of ball on collision and I wrote code how 2 hit bricks destroy (for thoose bricks which you have to hit 2 times) and etc.

## Conclusion: 
In this laboratory we learned how to work in a team and divide the tasks between members.
